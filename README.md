# DeepLearning
Hello! This project is me learning how to develop a Deep Learning model from scratch! I am programming in C++ and using industry standard tools such as Make, Gprof (for optimization), and VS Code debugger. A reason for this project is so that I can understand the fundamentals of Deep Learning, as well as programming something as difficult as a neural network without memory leaks and making sure that data is propagated correctly.

# Current State
Right now, I have finished making the neural networking and being able to select the activation function, network layer size, and it can even learn! I haven't implemented backpropagation, so right now the only way the network can learn is by assigning random values to the weights and biases of the network.
